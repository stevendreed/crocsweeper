# crocsweeper
A minesweeper clone using pygame

This project was initially developed as an attempt to develop a deeper understanding behind 3D arrays and class hierarchies in a simple environment.
The development goal for crocsweeper is as follows:

1. Display a grid of tiles which have hidden values. These hidden values should be the presence of a croc on the tile, or the number of nearby crocs
on each tile.

2. A full feature list for Github.

3. ...

n. Small, 8bit art of the crocodiles and some artistic dressing for the window.

n+1. A main menu to change the game mode, such as % of the map covered in crocs and the number of tiles on the game board.

n+2. A scoring system that can export player data to an external file: faster solves = more points.

n+3. Game art to "market" the software.

n+4. Chomping sounds and light, study-based tunes to practice intgrating audio elements into game.
