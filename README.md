# crocsweeper
A minesweeper clone using pygame

This project was initially developed as an attempt to develop a deeper understanding
behind 3D arrays and class hierarchies in a simple environment. The development goals
for crocsweeper are as follows:

1. Display a grid of tiles which have hidden values. These hidden values should be the
presence of a croc on the tile, or the number of nearby crocs on each tile.

2. A full feature list for Github.

3. User clicks a tile. That, and any adjacent tile which has a value of 0 is revealed
to the user. If the tile they selected also has a croc present, they lose.

4. Set up a win state so that if only croc tiles are not revealed, the user wins

5. Enable user notes on tiles: right click cycles through a question mark and a bite
mark (other marks TBD based on gameplay testing)

n. Small, 8bit art of the crocodiles and some artistic dressing for the window.

n+1. A main menu to change the game mode, such as % of the map covered in crocs and the
number of tiles on the game board.

n+2. A settings menu to let the user change window size, color, and volume of game.

n+3. A scoring system that can export player data to an external file: faster solves =
more points.

n+4. Game art to "market" the software.

n+5. Chomping sounds and light, study-based tunes to practice intgrating audio elements
into game.

n+6: on win, remaining crocs emerge and dance, perhaps in a band while a disco ball lowers
from the top of the window.
